This is a simple math app that will allow a user to create a study session. They can choose types of problems to include in the study session. While they are studying they can also change the types of problems to include in the study session. They should also choose how many problems. They can choose a finite number, all of them, or forever. It should also allow them to choose what format the questions should be in: multiple choice or fill in the blank.

How to start a study session:

- They can add as many study sets they want
- Then they choose how many problems they want to solve
